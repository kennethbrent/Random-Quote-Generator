// Hello! Thanks for reviewing my project. I want to note something I did differently than suggested by Treehouse.
//I have included the getRandomQuote function inside of the printQuote function. It didn't make any sense to me to 
//have them separate and I feel its cleaner like this. Please don't fail me for it! ;) I used jquery in the 
//randomColor function. Happy coding!
document.getElementById('loadQuote').addEventListener("click", () => {
	

	setRandomColor();
	printQuote();
	
});


var quotes = [
